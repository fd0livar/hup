Introduction
============

**Hup** is a multi-purpose `Python`_ library, which primarily aims to support
projects at `Frootlab`_ by a common base library. The majority of the comprised
modules, however, is kept generic and well documented, to facilitate their
application in other open source projects as well.

Hup was originally created in 2019 to allow a separation and extension of our
data analysis framework *Nemoa* within smaller and individually maintainable
subprojects `Deet`_, `Brea`_ and `Rian`_. For more information about these
projects see their respective project pages.
