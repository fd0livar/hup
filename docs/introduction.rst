Introduction
============

The *Frootlab Shared Library* (flib) is a multi-purpose `Python`_ library, which
primarily aims to support projects at `Frootlab`_ by a common base library. The
majority of the comprised modules, however, is kept generic and well documented,
to facilitate their application in other open source projects as well.

The Frootlab Shared Library was originally created in 2019 to allow a separation
of the collaborative data science platform *Nemoa* into smaller and
individually maintainable subprojects `Pandora`_, `Motley`_ and `Nemoa`_. For
more information about these projects see their respective project pages.
