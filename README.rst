The *Frootlab Shared Library* (flib) is a multi-purpose `Python`_ library, which
primarily aims to support `Frootlab`_ projects by serving as a common base
library. It was originally created in 2019 for `Project Infimum`_ to separate
`Pandora`_ and `Nemoa`_. The majority of the provided modules, however, are kept
generic to facilitate their application beyond Frootlab projects as well.

The Frootlab Shared Library is `open source`_, based on the `Python`_
programming language and actively developed at `Frootlab`_.

Current Development Status
--------------------------

The individual modules comprised within the Frootlab Shared Library are in
different development stages, ranging from *Planning* to *Mature*. In case of
doubt, the individual stages can be requested by the authors listed within the
`__authors__` attribute of the respective modules.

Installation
------------

Comprehensive information and installation support is provided within the
`online manual`_. If you already have a Python environment configured on your
computer, you can install the latest distributed version by using pip::

    $ pip install flib

Documentation
-------------

The documentation of the latest distributed version is available as an `online
manual`_ and for download, given in the formats `PDF`_, `EPUB`_ and `HTML`_.

Contribute
----------

Contributors are very welcome! Feel free to report bugs and feature requests to
the `issue tracker`_ provided by GitHub. Currently, as the Frootlab Developers
team still is growing, we do not provide any Contribution Guide Lines to
collaboration partners. However, if you are interested to join the team, we
would be glad, to receive an informal `application`_.
